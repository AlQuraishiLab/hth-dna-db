# hth-dna-db
Database of HTH-DNA complexes

This repository contains a database of structurally aligned helix-turn-helix (HTH) protein-DNA complexes along with their experimentally derived position-weight matrices. The source code (written in the Wolfram Language) for generating new databases with different parameter choices is also available in this repository. To faciliate the process of generating new databases, a Mathematica notebook that provides a walk through is provided in the notebook directory.
